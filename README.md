🎯 Design Patterns in C# (.NET Console Applications)

This repository contains complete, practical, and easy-to-understand implementations of all major Design Patterns using C# and .NET Console Applications.

The goal of this project is to:

Learn Design Patterns with real examples

Understand when & why to use each pattern

Provide interview-ready and production-style code

Serve as a reference repository for developers

📌 Solution Overview

The solution is organized into three main categories as per the GoF (Gang of Four) classification:

Design_Patterns_Repo
│
├── Behavioral_Design_Pattern
├── Creational_Design_Pattern
├── Structural_Design_Pattern
│
├── Design_Patterns_Repo.sln
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── instruction.txt


Each design pattern is implemented as a separate .NET Console project, making it easy to:

Run

Debug

Understand independently

🧠 Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns focus on communication and responsibility between objects.

├── Iterator_DesignPattern
├── Mediator_DesignPattern
├── Memento_DesignPattern
├── Observer_DesignPattern
├── State_DesignPattern
├── Strategy_DesignPattern
├── Template_DesignPattern
└── Visitor_DesignPattern

Covered Patterns

Chain of Responsibility

Iterator

Mediator

Memento

Observer

State

Strategy

Template Method

Visitor

🏗️ Creational Design Patterns

These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms.

├── AbstractFactory_DesignPattern
├── Builder_DesignPattern
├── Factory_DesignPattern
├── Prototype_DesignPattern
└── Singleton_DesignPattern

Covered Patterns

Singleton

Factory Method

🧩 Structural Design Patterns

These patterns focus on object composition and structure.

Structural_Design_Pattern
│
├── Adapter_DesignPattern
├── Bridge_DesignPattern
├── Composite_DesignPattern
├── Decorator_DesignPattern
├── Facade_DesignPattern
├── Flyweight_DesignPattern
└── Proxy_DesignPattern

Covered Patterns

▶️ How to Run Any Design Pattern Project
Option 1: Using Visual Studio Code
cd Behavioral_Design_Pattern/Strategy_DesignPattern
dotnet run

Option 2: Using Visual Studio

Open Design_Patterns_Repo.sln

Set the required project as Startup Project

Press Run (F5)

🧪 Project Structure (Inside Each Pattern)

Each project generally contains:

Program.cs – Entry point & demo

Pattern-specific classes

Clear naming aligned with pattern roles

Console output to explain flow

🎯 Who Is This Repository For?

✔ Beginners learning Design Patterns
✔ C# / .NET Developers
✔ Interview Preparation
✔ Clean Architecture learners
✔ Software Engineers revising GoF patterns

💡 Design Philosophy

Simple & Practical examples

No unnecessary complexity

Console-based for clarity

Focused on understanding, not frameworks
