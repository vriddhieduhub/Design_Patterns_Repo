# Design Patterns in C# (.NET Console Applications)

This repository contains practical and easy-to-understand implementations of all major Design Patterns using C# and .NET Console Applications.

The purpose of this project is to provide:
- A clear understanding of GoF Design Patterns
- Real-world inspired examples
- Interview-ready reference implementations
- A structured way to learn, revise, and practice design patterns

Each design pattern is implemented as an independent console project.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication, interaction, and responsibility between objects.

Patterns included:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

---

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, improving flexibility and reuse.

Patterns included:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

---

## Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns focus on object composition and class structure.

Patterns included:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## How to Run Any Project

Using Command Line / VS Code:

cd Behavioral_Design_Pattern/Strategy_DesignPattern
dotnet run

Using Visual Studio:
1. Open Design_Patterns_Repo.sln
2. Set the required project as Startup Project
3. Run the application (F5)

---

## Project Design Approach

- Each design pattern is implemented as one independent project
- Code is kept simple and readable
- Examples focus on understanding the pattern, not frameworks
- Console output is used to explain behavior clearly
